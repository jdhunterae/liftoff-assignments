# Project Outline

## Overview

> In 1-2 paragraphs, provide an “elevator pitch” for your project. This should be a high-level overview of your idea, in non-technical language. What will your app do? What might users find useful about it? Where did the idea come from?

## Features

* **User login**: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
* **Search**: Users will be able to search for travel posts containing given text or by location or user.
* **Create Post**: Users will be able to create new travel posts when logged in. New posts will appear in the user’s profile.

## Technologies

* Java
* Spring Boot
* MySQL
* Hibernate
* Thymeleaf templates
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* React (?)

## What I'll Have to Learn

> In the course of building your project, you’ll have to learn something new. Perhaps you want to use data from a public API, or add a bit of JavaScript to make your front-end more interactive. If you can’t name the exact technology or technique that you’ll have to learn, you should still be able to describe a problem that you have identified that you don’t currently know how to solve.
