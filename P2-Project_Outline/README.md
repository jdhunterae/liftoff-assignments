# Project Outline

## Overview

> In 1-2 paragraphs, provide an “elevator pitch” for your project. This should be a high-level overview of your idea, in non-technical language. What will your app do? What might users find useful about it? Where did the idea come from?

## Features

> List 3-5 features that you will implement in your project. Each feature should have a name and a 1-2 sentence description. Here are a few examples for a blog application:
>
> * **User login**: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
> * **Search**: Users will be able to search for blog posts containing given text.
> * **Create Post**: Users will be able to create new blog posts when logged in. New posts will appear in the user’s profile.

## Technologies

> What languages and technologies will you use to build your application? For example, for the coding-events application from Unit 2 - Java, the technologies would be:
>
> * Java
> * Spring Boot
> * MySQL
> * Hibernate
> * Thymeleaf templates

## What I'll Have to Learn

> In the course of building your project, you’ll have to learn something new. Perhaps you want to use data from a public API, or add a bit of JavaScript to make your front-end more interactive. If you can’t name the exact technology or technique that you’ll have to learn, you should still be able to describe a problem that you have identified that you don’t currently know how to solve.
