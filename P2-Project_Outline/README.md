# Project Outline

## Overview

The next big thing in social media for travellers is `Travlog` (placeholder name).

Our travel-based social media will allow users to create posts about their travels and vacations
that are tagged to geo-locations (landmarks, cities, etc). They can post pictures and short
text posts about their experience and their findings. They will also be able to search
other user posts regarding that location to see what others have done and thought.

Users will also be able to favorite and save different posts or locations to a `bucket list` of
places they have, or would like to, visit.

## Features

* **User login**: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
* **Search**: Users will be able to search for travel posts containing given text or by location or user.
* **Create Post**: Users will be able to create new travel posts when logged in. New posts will appear in the userâ€™s profile.

## Technologies

* Java
* Spring Boot
* MySQL
* Hibernate
* Thymeleaf templates
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* React (?)

## What I'll Have to Learn

Besides continuing to brush up on my skills with Java SpringBoot, MySQL, and web templating. I will
likely need to learn more about AJAX and Javascript programming to be able to update pages
as the user clicks to filter and un-filter different options.
